# Over the Road

## 1. Overview

According to the introduction on [their official website](https://www.overtheroad.fm/):

> Over the Road is an eight-part series that gives voice to the trials and triumphs of America's long haul truckers. Host "Long Haul Paul" Marhoefer, a musician, storyteller and trucker for nearly 40 years, takes you behind the wheel to explore a devoted community and a world that's changing amidst new technologies and regulations.

## 2. Listening to Improve

### 2.1 Ep. 1: The Biggest Tailgate in Trucking

> That's the most tender beef jerky you'll **ever eat**.

The speaker connects the ending `r` in "ever" and the beginning "e" in "eat" to make it sound like "reat". Need to pay attention to such connected speech.

---

> We've got our new - 579 **Ultra Loft** and it's blackout...

The speaker pronounces the word "ultra" in a way I'm unfamiliar with: the "u" sounds pretty flat, and the "a" sounds like the letter "o". I caught the word "loft" but missed "ultra".

---

> I'm proud to say I can't afford a real one, but I can **hook you up** with a real **nice toy one**.

The speaker says "hook you up" so quickly that "you" becomes a really slightly pronounced "[ja]" so I missed the word "you" when I listened to it. He also connects "toy one" in a way that "toy" sounds like "toyo". As a result, "nice toy one" sounds like "nai stoyo one" to me.

---

> But for many long-time gearjammers, **MATS** signifies something more.

I didn't catch "MATS". I thought Paul said "That's". But I should have figured out that earlier because:
- Paul did pronounce "ts" at the end of this word.
- "that's signifies ..." is grammatically wrong. So it can't be "that's" but something else.

---

> Everything you see **at the store**, everything you buy online...

Somehow, I didn't heard "at the store" clearly. I thought he said "in a store".

---

> Refrigerator **freight** trucks, they **call'em** reefer trucks.

I didn't catch "freight". I thought the trucker said "fridge" so, in the whole sentence, I thought he said "refrigerator or fridge trucks". But I could have figured out that, too, because:
- Had the trucker said "refrigerator or fridge trucks", I should be able to hear "ror" that connects "refrigerator" and "or", but I didn't. So it can't be "refrigerator or". It must be something else.

The problem is I still can't tell **"i"** and **"a"** clearly.

Regarding "**call'em**", the trucker pronounced "em" so slightly that it sounds like "er".

---

> Eric: **Car haulers** we call'em **parking lots**.
>
> Jason: A bed bugger is a furniture **hauler**.

I think Eric has a very strong accent that I have never heard before but I totally missed his entire sentence. I kind of caught what Jason said. The most important word is **"hauler"**.

---

**ATTENTION**

> ... and it's pretty much the biggest change **that's come to** our culture, ...

I didn't understand "that's come to". I thought Paul was saying "contour" which makes no sense in this context. I didn't understand it probably because I'm unfamiliar with the use of "that's come" because I've always said "that has come".

---

**ATTENTION**

> Hundreds of big **rigs** **took over** highway 99 **in** protest today...

I missed three parts in this short sentence:
- 1). I didn't know the word "rig" (which means a truck in the American English).
- 2). The reporter said "took over" so quickly that I thought he said "go over".
- 3). Probably "in protest" is a fixed phrase. I thought he said "and". But if he said "took over" earlier, this can't be "and" because "protest" is not in the past form.

---

> Trucker 6: It's actually **just a wooden** floor you can get **at** Home Depot.

I didn't hear "just" and "wooden" clearly. The "at" was also pronounced very slightly.

---

**ATTENTION**

> For the competition itself, trucks are organized into different sections, marked off with plastic **ropes**.

I didn't figure out the word "rope". I thought it was "row".

### 2.2 Ep. 2: Why We Drive

> Or my personal favorite, those **pearl-snapped** **plaid-shirted** prodigies who were big riggin' before they could even shave.

I missed almost the entire sentence mostly because I'm unfamiliar with the words "pearl-snapped", "plaid-shirted", "prodigy", and "rigging". But I need to learn at least these two hyphen connected phrases, `pearl-snapped` and `plaid-shirted`, that describe the look of a person.

---

**ATTENTION**

> Paul: [As narrator] But these days about **as** many types of folks drive trucks **as** drive cars.

I totally missed this sentence, too, because I misheard the two "as"'s as "is"'s. My obstacles are:
- 1). I'm quite familiar with the structure "as many as" when they are said altogether. However, when something long is inserted between "as many" and "as", as this sentence does, I'm lost.
- 2). "as" and "is" still sound quite similar to me so I can't tell them.
- 3). More importantly, the context couldn't help me. Paul is telling some new information in this sentence which I feel is impossible to deduce from the contents before this sentence. Therefore, clear hearing is very important to catch the meaning of the sentence. However, my ears are not yet sharp enough to catch the whole "as many ... as" structure.

---

> One day, I asked one of the drivers, I think he went by **Red**, ... As we exited the lot, **Red** waved to the guard **shack** and lit up a **camel**

I missed "shack" because I haven't learned this word. I didn't recognize "Red" as the driver's name even though I just heard it a few seconds ago. I think this is because "Red" happens to be a common word, too. If the driver's name were "David" or "Michael", I would have recognized that more easily. I know the cigarette brand "camel" but didn't recognize it here. I think it's all because I'm not familiar with it enough.

---

**ATTENTION**

> Paul: That transmission **he had in** there was like nothing I'd ever seen before. Every shift was **accompanied** by a whoosh of air, the clicking of gears all **finding** their own place. There was a sorcery to it all. Me and **ol'** Red riding high in that tobacco-and-sweat-cured cab. We must have been seven, eight, nine feet above the ground, awash in the rumble, the flutter, the roar.

>
> Truck cabs can be tailored with amenities like ergonomically designed air suspension seating, professional sound systems and attachment sections for resting or sleeping.

### 3.6 Chicken Lights

"Those strings of amber lights on 18-wheelers are known as _chicken lights_." ([Chicken Lights on Trucks](https://www.waywordradio.org/chicken-light-trucks/))

> Have you ever wondered where the term "Chicken Lights" came from? One legend says that the truckers in the 1920s, driving slow trucks on then-dark streets, were often the victims of thieves as they moved loads of chickens through small towns. To help stop this problem, truckers started putting lanterns around their cargo – thus the name, Chicken Lights. ([The Spirit Of The American Trucker – May 2014](https://www.tenfourmagazine.com/2014/05/the-spirit-of-the-american-trucker/spirit-of-the-american-trucker-may-2014/))

### 3.7 Bobtail Truck

According to [What is a Bobtail Truck and Why is it Dangerous?](https://tortslaw.com/blog/bobtail-truck/):

> A semi-truck is in "bobtail" mode when it does not have a trailer attached. Truck drivers often drive a bobtail truck when they are on their way to pick up their cargo at the beginning of a shift, or after dropping their cargo off at the end.
>
> Bobtailing should not be confused with "deadheading," which is the term for hauling an empty trailer.
>
> The reason bobtail trucks are more hazardous is that they are more difficult to maneuver and brake. Truck drivers must take extra care when driving a bobtail truck to avoid accidents.
>
> Trucks are designed to carry heavy trailers, which they do most of the time. Therefore, much of their braking power is in the rear axle, under the trailer. When a truck is in bobtail configuration, there is very little weight over the rear axle, and braking power is reduced.
>
> Instead, the majority of the weight of a bobtail truck is over the front wheels, whose primary purpose is steering rather than braking. This makes bobtail trucks more susceptible to skidding out in tight curves or sudden turns.
>
> For the same reason, bobtail trucks also often have a longer braking distance, even though they weigh less.

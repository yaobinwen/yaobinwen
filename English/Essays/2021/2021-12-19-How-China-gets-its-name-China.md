# How China Gets Its Name "China"?

> TL;DR: For a long time, I thought "China" was named after china, the material for which China is well known. However, the Internet tells me that China was probably named after the town "Changnan," where the precious porcelain was made. Or, as more people worldwide believe, including Britannica, China gets the name from its first unified dynasty, "Qin" (秦).

It looks like people tend to believe the name "China" comes from the first unified imperial dynasty, "Qin" (秦). [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Qin-dynasty) says so in the article for the Qin dynasty (and so do many other resources I read):

> The Qin—which lasted only from 221 to 207 BCE but from which the name China is derived—established the approximate boundaries...

But [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug-tG_5WILo) mentions another possibility that the word "China" gets its origin from what ancient India called China. However, historians still speculate that the Indian name also refers to the Qin Dynasty. "China was not named after china," said the video in the end.

But I did find another article saying the word "China" comes from the town "Changnan":

> The porcelain china is the transliteration of the place name Changnan, which was the old name for the porcelain town of today's Jingdezhen (Jingde Town). ... As time passed, people in Europe forgot the meaning of Changnan and switched the original meaning of porcelain of the word 'china' to the place of its origin ― China.

This theory is also briefly mentioned in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hx6OeIIC_k&t=53s).

> ... most of the world's porcelain came from a town called "Changnan". Warped by the foreign tongues of ancient ceramics traders, "Changnan" became "China".

Fine. China still doesn't seem to get its name from china.

# List of English Words of Chinese Origin

Today, I came across the ["List of English Words of Chinese Origin" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Chinese_origin). The list shows two significant influences of English words of such: Mandarin and Cantonese.

As I read through the list, I was not surprised when I found that English words such as "Kung fu" and "Lo mein" have Chinese origins. Likewise, I found some familiarity in the word "Tai-Pan" because I saw it in Maugham's works. But I was surprised that **"ketchup"** has a Chinese origin, too.

The Wikipedia page explains the origin briefly:

> In the 17th century, the Chinese mixed a concoction of pickled fish and spices and called it (in the Amoy dialect) kôe-chiap or kê-chiap (鮭汁) meaning the brine of pickled fish (鮭, salmon; 汁, juice) or shellfish. By the early 18th century, the sauce had made it to the Malay states (present day Malaysia and Singapore), where it was later discovered by English explorers. That word then gradually evolved into the English word "ketchup", and was taken to the American colonies by English settlers.

I also found [an article "ketchup" in a blog](https://theheartthrills.com/2020/08/09/ketchup/) that provides a more detailed explanation.

Check out the words on the list. You'll have a lot of fun there.

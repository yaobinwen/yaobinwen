# English: My Notes of Learning English

## 1. Overview

I am from China; my mother tongue is Mandarin. I'm currently living in the United States and I need to speak English in order to buy coffee in Starbucks. So learning English is very important!

This repository keeps the notes I make when I'm learning English. It also has the references to the external materials and the essays about what I've learned.

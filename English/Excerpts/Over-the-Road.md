## Ep 1: The Biggest Tailgate in Trucking

> Traffic came to **a screeching halt** at the junction of I-75 and I-640

"a screeching halt":
- a sudden stop by a vehicle that makes a long, loud, high noise that is unpleasant to hear:
  - Eventually, the car came to a screeching halt.
  - The train is brought to a screeching halt by a band of outlaws.
- a sudden and unexpected end to something:
  - My young career very nearly came to a screeching halt.
  - Indiana put a screeching halt to Charlotte's five-game winning streak with a 133-96 pounding.

> _What seconds before had been_ a perfectly picked personal watermelon, was now **prolapsing** through its **ruptured** rind, down the **crumpled** exterior of _what had once been_ the trailer's stainless-steel door, and onto my trembling hand.

Pay attention to the three highlighted words that can vividly describe what happened and what exactly the objects looked like, especially the word `crumpled` which describes what the trailer's door looked like after being hit by the truck from behind.

Also pay attention to the two uses of "what had been".

We must have been seven, eight, nine feet above the ground, **awash in the rumble, the flutter, the roar**.

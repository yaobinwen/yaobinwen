Learn the use of "duality" in the sentences below:

> In writing this story, I was inspired by the wisdom of many Jewish traditions that contain elements of both sweet and bitter, or happy and sad. While use of the phrase - bitter and sweet - is my own way of acknowledging this **duality** in everyday life, Judaism and Jewish teachings provide many wonderful ways to recognize that life holds some of both.

"I have a question for you. (giggling) Do you have your toilet paper **coming over the top**, or do you have it **coming from (the) behind**?" Source: [88 Bathroom Vocabulary Words](https://youtu.be/FW4QtFDXxAQ?t=493)

Note:
- In the video, Vanessa seemed to have a very slightly pronounced "a" between "from" and "behind" which sounded like she said "the" by connecting it with "from". However, the word "behind" is seldom used as a noun. It's mostly used as a preposition or an adverb, so it shouldn't follow the definite article "the". As a matter of fact, if you search for the phrase "from the behind" on Google, most of the results are about "from behind".
- You could say "at the back of sth.", or "behind sth", but not "at the behind of sth.". When "behind" is used as a noun, it means "the part of the body on which a person sits". For example:
  - He tripped and fell on his behind.
  - Why don't you get off your behind (= stand up) and do something!

>  The first happened holding my father's hand while he died. I listened to his final breaths, **gasping and fish-like**, and I gripped his hand tight enough to feel the last pulsings of his heart.

[Wire Strain Relief Connectors and Cord Grips](https://www.waytekwire.com/products/1489/Strain-Reliefs/):

> Strain relief connectors protect your connections from dust, moisture, chemicals and physical forces to ensure a longer wiring life. Strain reliefs reinforce mechanical strength and electrical integrity, especially in highly volatile environments with **wide fluctuations in temperature and movement**.
>
> Dynamic applications require components that allow for free movement. Standard dome cable glands and strain reliefs are great for securely holding wires in place, but if they are used in a non-static application, they could cause **kinking and chaffing** to occur and cause damage to the wire.
>
> Cord Grips are used in industries where cables and wires are exposed to exceptional loads. Heat and cold, tensile and compressive loads, plus wear-and-tear can cause damage to cables and result in malfunctions and loss of production. Cord Grips provide a reliable solution for securing wires in place while providing excellent pass through protection.

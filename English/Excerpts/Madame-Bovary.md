# Excerpts: Madame Bovary

## Overview

The following paragraphs are excerpted from [the English version translated by Eleanor Marx-Aveling on the Gutenberg Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2413/2413-h/2413-h.htm).

I referred to the Chinese version by 许渊冲 to understand some of the description.

## Chapter 03

下面这一段对室内场景的描写值得参考，尤其是描述阳光的那个部分。

> One day he got there about three o’clock. Everybody was in the fields. He went into the kitchen, but did not at once catch sight of Emma; the outside shutters were closed. Through the chinks of the wood the sun sent across the flooring long fine rays that were broken at the corners of the furniture and trembled along the ceiling. Some flies on the table were crawling up the glasses that had been used, and buzzing as they drowned themselves in the dregs of the cider. The daylight that came in by the chimney made velvet of the soot at the back of the fireplace, and touched with blue the cold cinders. Between the window and the hearth Emma was sewing; she wore no fichu; he could see small drops of perspiration on her bare shoulders.

下面这一段则着重描写了Emma的一些行为，并通过她的行为一定程度上塑造了她的性格：

> After the fashion of country folks she asked him to have something to drink. He said no; she insisted, and at last laughingly offered to have a glass of liqueur with him. So she went to fetch a bottle of curacao from the cupboard, reached down two small glasses, filled one to the brim, poured scarcely anything into the other, and, after having clinked glasses, carried hers to her mouth. As it was almost empty she bent back to drink, her head thrown back, her lips pouting, her neck on the strain. She laughed at getting none of it, while with the tip of her tongue passing between her small teeth she licked drop by drop the bottom of her glass.

## Chapter 07

> As he had been for a time accustomed to wear nightcaps, his handkerchief would not **keep down over his ears**, so that his hair in the morning was all **tumbled pell-mell about his face** and **whitened with the feathers of the pillow, whose strings came untied during the night**. He always wore thick boots that had **two long creases over the instep running obliquely towards the ankle**, while the rest of the upper continued in a straight line as if stretched on a wooden foot. He said that "was quite good enough for the country."

下面这两段文字则描述出婆媳之间复杂微秒的感情，以及"儿子/老公"夹在中间的无奈。从两个段落可以看出来：
- 作为"儿子/老公"的男人，需要有自己的判断能力，明白什么对自己是需要的(因此他希望别人做到)，什么是不需要的(因此如果别人没有做到，他会认为无所谓)。有自己的判断力之后，一个人才不会被别人的观点轻易影响。
- 这里母亲的指责一定程度上可以理解。但是Charles其实应该注意到一点：他的母亲为他做出那些"sacrifice"以及承受那些"trouble"的时候，Charles有一些时间还未成年，所以那个时候不是他的母亲为了他而做出牺牲，而是他的母亲为了她自己感受更好而做出牺牲。
- 虽然母亲的指责一定程度上不合适，但并不是说她不值得同情。Charles应该明白，无论母亲曾经为他做的事情是真心为了他还是更多地为了她自己，Charles都是那个实际"享受好处"的人。他不应该认为他以前得到的东西都是理所应当的。他应该要照顾母亲的感受，不要把过多的精力都投入到妻子身上。
- 一个人说的话很可能只是冰山一角。他/她真实的想法很可能九曲十八弯地隐藏在这些话语的后面。

> In Madame Dubuc's time the old woman felt that she was still the favorite; but now the love of Charles for Emma seemed to her a desertion from her tenderness, an encroachment upon what was hers, and she watched her son's happiness in sad silence, as a ruined man looks through the windows at people dining in his old house. She recalled to him as remembrances her troubles and her sacrifices, and, comparing these with Emma's negligence, came to the conclusion that it was not reasonable to adore her so exclusively.
>
> Charles knew not what to answer: he respected his mother, and he loved his wife infinitely; he considered the judgment of the one infallible, and yet he thought the conduct of the other irreproachable. When Madam Bovary had gone, he tried timidly and in the same terms to hazard one or two of the more anodyne observations he had heard from his mamma. Emma proved to him with a word that he was mistaken, and sent him off to his patients.

## Parts of Speech: 词类(aka 词性)

**Part of speech 词类(aka 词性)**

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech):

> In traditional grammar, a **part of speech** or **part-of-speech** (abbreviated as **POS** or **PoS**) is a category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) that have similar grammatical properties. Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar syntactic behavior—they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences—and sometimes similar morphology in that they undergo inflection for similar properties.
>
> Commonly listed English parts of speech are noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, numeral, article, or determiner.

**conjunction 连词**

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(grammar)):

> In grammar, a conjunction (abbreviated CONJ or CNJ) is a part of speech that connects words, phrases, or clauses that are called the conjuncts of the conjunctions. This definition may overlap with that of other parts of speech, so what constitutes a "conjunction" must be defined for each language. In English, a given word may have several senses, being either a preposition or a conjunction depending on the syntax of the sentence. For example, after is a preposition in "he left after the fight", but it is a conjunction in "he left after they fought". In general, a conjunction is an invariable (non-inflected) grammatical particle and it may or may not stand between the items conjoined.

Examples: and, or, but

# Pool and Eight-ball

## Overview

Eight-ball is a popular pool game found in the United States. I enjoy the game a lot but also want to learn how to describe or talk about the game in English with my friends. All the words and expressions are in the context of eight-ball and American English (British English sometimes uses different terms.).

See the following pages for references:

## Words

- The balls:
  - The balls are generally referred to as **billiard balls** which consist of one **cue ball** and 15 **object balls**.
  - The object balls are divided into two **groups** or **suits**: the solid-colored group/suit and the striped group/suit.
- The table:
  - The cloth-covered table is generally referred to as a **billiard table**.
  - It has 6 **pockets**, with two **center pockets** and four **corner pockets**.
  - The table has four **cushions** or **sides**:
    - **end/short/foot rail**: Either of the two shorter rails of the table.
    - **side/long rail**: Either of the two longer rails of a billiards table.
  - The table has a **head string** which is a line, sometimes imaginary (especially in American pool), sometimes drawn on the cloth, that runs horizontally across the table.
  - The area on the table behind the head string is called **kitchen**. See [2] for a possible explanation of the term's origin.
- The stick:
  - **cue stick**
  - A **mechanical bridge** is a special stick that helps guide the cue stick. In American English, it's also called **bridge**, **bridge stick**, or **rake**.
    - In British English, a bridge stick is also called a **rest**. There are three types of commonly used rests (see [2] for more details):
      - swan (or goose neck)
      - spider: Looks similar to a rake bridge in eight-ball but has longer legs.
      - cross
- The **triangle rack** is the equipment that is used to place billiard balls in their starting positions at the beginning of a game.
- The play:
  - **break shot**: The first shot of a game.
  - **call a pocket**: Designate the pocket that the 8-ball should be pocketed.
  - **rack the balls**: Place the object balls in the triangle rack for a setup.
  - **pocket/sink a ball**: To send a ball into a pocket, usually intentionally.
  - **snooker**:
    - As a verb: To leave the opponent (accidentally or by means of a safety) so that a certain shot on a preferred object ball cannot be played directly in a straight line by normal cueing.
    - As a noun: An instance of this situation (e.g. "She's put him in a difficult snooker").
  - **cut shot**: Technically, any shot that is not a center-to-center hit, but almost always employed when describing a shot that has more than a slight degree of angle.
    - **cut angle**:
    - **back cut**: A back cut is a cut shot where the cue ball is shot well away from the target pocket, for example, when the cue ball is much closer to the target pocket rail than the object ball (i.e., where youâ€™re cutting the OB back toward the rail the cue is over).
    - **overcutting**: Hit the object ball too thin.
    - **undercutting**: Hit the object ball too full.

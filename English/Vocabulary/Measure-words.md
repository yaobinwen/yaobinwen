## 4. Wrong Usage

This section lists the wrong uses of the measure words.

## 5. Miscellaneous

### 5.1 Bananas

See [3] for the source.

> How to speak banana

>A single plant can produce bunches of bananas, but not the "bunch" you see at the store. A single banana is called a **finger**. A grouping of attached "fingers" make up a **"hand"** of bananas. Multiple hands that grow in a cluster are called a **bunch** or **stalk**—a bunch of bananas may contain 3 to 20 hands!

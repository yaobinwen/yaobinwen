# Hard-to-Pronounce Words

## 1. Overview

This document collects the words, phrases, and expressions are hard to pronounce correctly.

I watched the video [73 WORDS YOU CAN'T PRONOUNCE in American English... & how to say them correctly!](https://youtu.be/B9a_6diguCs) in which Stefanie shared 73 words that are hard to pronounce correctly. But there are more other even harder-to-pronounce-correctly words which I'm trying to collect here.

## 2. How to Practice

- Step 1: Practice pronouncing the word itself.
- Step 2: Put the word in a whole sentence to practice. I find even if I can pronounce a word well enough individually, when it's put in a whole sentence, I still can't pronounce it well.
  - For example, I practiced pronouncing the word `anesthetist` separately and I could do it well. When I put it into a sentence, e.g., "His cousin is an anesthetist in the community hospital.", I still couldn't pronounce it well enough. I guess it's because when practicing the individual word, I can put my full attention on this word; when reading a whole sentence, I must put some of my attention on the other words, the accent, the mood, and the tone of the sentence, so I can't fully concentrate on one word. Therefore, my brain gets distracted when it comes to this word in the whole sentence and I can't pronounce it well again.

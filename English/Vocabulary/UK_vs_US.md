### The "Could Be Wrong" List

People say it's easy to turn the pronunciation from British accent to American accent. For example, add `/r/` to `/ɔː/` (e.g., "water"); turn `/ɒ/` into `/ɑː/` (e.g., "hot"). More examples: `park`, `car`, and `before`. However, if not used appropriately, these rules could result in wrong pronunciations which are used by neither. For example, the letters "au" in "cause" are pronounced as `/ɔː/` in British accent, but one can't simply add `/r/` and pronounce it as `/kɔːrz/` in order to pronounce it in "American" way. The American pronunciation is different.

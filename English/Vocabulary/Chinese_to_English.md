# Chinese to English

## Overview

I often find I have a Chinese idiom in mind but don't know the corresponding English word or phrase. This document tries to capture the English counterparts of the commonly used Chinese idioms.

The Chinese words are organized by their _pinyin_ spellings. For example, "坚毅"(jian yi) comes before "康复"(kang fu) but after "富强"(fu qiang).

# Mental Models

## Prioritize work

80/20 law

## Set a deadline

Parkinson's law: If you don't set a deadline, the work will take as much time as you provide.

## Focus on one task and avoid distraction

Nowadays people like the idea of "multi-tasking" and, in my opinion, in many situations, multi-tasking is needed. But people should not forget the importance of focusing on **one task** and **get it done**.

Avoid distraction, especially social media. Try to do "deep work".

## 行动协同原则(synthetic actions): 所有的行动都应该为目标服务

> When you are working on a goal, make sure all your actions cooperate with and strengthen, rather than conflict with and thus weaken, each other, to produce a greater power than doing them separately.

## Follow your fears

那些让我很担心、焦虑、害怕的事情，是阻碍我正常生活的事情，与其一味逃避它们，不如正视它们。所以我需要持续地关注这些事情。

## Use the books rather than just read them

Many times people brag about how many books they read in a year. But finishing reading the books doesn't mean the books help you improve your life. You must integrate what you have learned from the books into your daily life.  Simply put: **USE THEM**. So what really counts is the number of books you have **actually used**.

## Manage energy instead of time

You can't manage your time. What you need to do is manage your energy.

- 🌟[yaobinwen/Linux-Lab](https://github.com/yaobinwen/Linux-Lab): How to create a home lab to study Linux kernal and C/C++ libraries (and possibly everything else).
- [yaobinwen/cpython](https://github.com/yaobinwen/cpython): Since I started to work on Python a few years ago, I realized how important it is to understand the internal details of this language. I forked the C implementation to learn how the language works.
- [yaobinwen/dpkg](https://github.com/yaobinwen/dpkg): I work on Ubuntu and manage the Debian package building and publishing in my company, so I use [dpkg(1)](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man1/dpkg.1.html) a lot. I forked the source code in order to learn the tool and **Perl**. See my README file [dpkg: Annotated Version](https://github.com/yaobinwen/dpkg/blob/master/README.md).
  - Along with `dpkg(1)`, I also use [yaobinwen/debhelper](https://github.com/yaobinwen/debhelper) tool suite.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Yaobin, a software developer.

Being a software developer, I am maintaining my **tech blog** in [yaobinwen.github.io](https://yaobinwen.github.io/) which discusses topics related with computer technologies.

[yaobinwen/robin_on_rails](https://github.com/yaobinwen/robin_on_rails) contains the randome notes or thoughts that are generated when I read technical articles. The repository looks a bit messy due to the messy nature of the thoughts and notes. My plan is to gradually turn them into articles once I've accumulated enough in the related topics.

[yaobinwen/work-env](https://github.com/yaobinwen/work-env) contains the scripts, guides, and programs that help me quickly set up my own work environment.

### GitHub Repositories

Sometimes a technical topic is best explored with code or a sandbox environment. I've created the following GitHub repositories for such topics:

- [yaobinwen/backporting-gl2ps](https://github.com/yaobinwen/backporting-gl2ps): This repository discusses the issue I ran into when backporting `gl2ps` from Ubuntu Impish to Ubuntu Bionic by looking deep into two packages: `debhelper` and CMake.
- [yaobinwen/cpp-static-dynamic-linking](https://github.com/yaobinwen/cpp-static-dynamic-linking): My study on how GCC static linking and dynamic linking should be configured to work.
- [yaobinwen/git-log-S-G](https://github.com/yaobinwen/git-log-S-G): Explain how `git log -S` and `git log -G` work using the repository itself.
- [yaobinwen/react-box](https://github.com/yaobinwen/react-box): My notes and code of about React.js and MUI.

### Work in Progress

I usually work on multiple projects concurrently, because my daily job requires me to learn a wide range of technologies, from as low level as dealing with hardware all the way up to as high as developing user-facing web frontend. I know a lot of people don't like this and critize that I'm in lack of a focus. To some degree, I agree with that. The division of labor in modern society awards the people who focus on one thing and do it really well, and by spreading my attention to different areas, I am putting myself to a position of disadvantage compared to many others.

However, I'm arguing what I'm doing have benefits, too:
- 1). I want to do it due to curiosity. Being a developer, I am curious by nature. Learning different technologies opens my eyes and fulfills my curiousity.
- 2). This wide coverage of technologies allows me to learn how to develop a complete product from ground zero. I will have the chance to think from the perspectives of different levels of product development and be able to oversee the entire development lifecycle.
- 3). I have the motivation to keep learning "how to learn more efficiently" because I need to keep learning new stuff and use them for my work. Knowledge can go out-dated quickly. But the ability of learning knowledge gets only sharpened more as time goes by. I do agree that knowledge is important (because it makes you able to do the work), but I also believe the ability of learning is even more important (because it allows people to adapt quickly, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence).

I'm actively working on the following projects but they are not finished yet:
- [yaobinwen/Web-Dev-Birds-Eye](https://github.com/yaobinwen/Web-Dev-Birds-Eye): A Bird's-eye view of web development to help novice web developers to speed up learning.
- [yaobinwen/cmake-explained](https://github.com/yaobinwen/cmake-explained): A tutorial of modern CMake.
- [yaobinwen/error-handling](https://github.com/yaobinwen/error-handling): My learning and thinking over error reporting and handling in programming.
- [yaobinwen/ssh-tunneling-explained](https://github.com/yaobinwen/ssh-tunneling-explained): Explain what is SSH tunneling and how to use it.
- [yaobinwen/floating-point-numbers](https://github.com/yaobinwen/floating-point-numbers): My study and notes regarding floating-point numbers.
- [yaobinwen/systemd-explained](https://github.com/yaobinwen/systemd-explained): A tutorial of `systemd`.
- [yaobinwen/local-https](https://github.com/yaobinwen/local-https): Deploy a local HTTPS web service which is good for local testing and experimenting.
- [yaobinwen/Linux-Lab](https://github.com/yaobinwen/Linux-Lab): How to create a home lab to study Linux kernal and C/C++ libraries (and possibly everything else).
- [yaobinwen/document-shredded](https://github.com/yaobinwen/document-shredded): This project collects documentation good practices with examples and bad practices as counter-examples in order to create a repeatible process of creating easy-to-understand documentation.
- [yaobinwen/myPSP](https://github.com/yaobinwen/myPSP): A self-improvement software process for software engineers to improve the work quality _precisely_, _quantitatively_, and _continuously_.
- [yaobinwen/dpkg](https://github.com/yaobinwen/dpkg): I work on Ubuntu and manage the Debian package building and publishing in my company, so I use [dpkg(1)](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man1/dpkg.1.html) a lot. I forked the source code in order to learn the tool and **Perl**. See my README file [dpkg: Annotated Version](https://github.com/yaobinwen/dpkg/blob/master/README.md).
  - Along with `dpkg(1)`, I also use [yaobinwen/debhelper](https://github.com/yaobinwen/debhelper) tool suite.

### Health & Energy Management

No matter you like it or not, time elapses second by second and you _can't_ manage it. What you can manage it your _energy_, as argued in the book [_The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68985.The_Power_of_Full_Engagement). The page [Health](./Health.md) lists my habbits of maintaining good health and energy level.

### Non-tech

- [Thoughts](./Thoughts): My personal thoughts on things that may or may not be important.
- [Non-tech books, articles, movies, shows, talks, and so on](./Petals).
- [Chinese](./Chinese): Being a Chinese, I surely learned Chinese in schools. However, I didn't realize why I had to learn the language if it's already my mother tongue. I learned everything with the purpose of passing the examinations. One day in 2018, when I was sitting in my apartment in Pittsburgh, PA, it occurred to me that I had always learned Chinese for examinations but not for the language itself. Since then, I started to re-learn Chinese, including the classic Chinese literature.
- [English](./English): Originally from China, currently living in the United States, I need to keep learning English.
- [Nonviolent Communication (NVC)](https://www.cnvc.org/): Being an NVC practitioner, I believe this communication method can improve the quality of life, for me and others around me.

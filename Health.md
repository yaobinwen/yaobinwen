# Health & Energy Management

The idea of managing energy instead of time comes from the book [_The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68985.The_Power_of_Full_Engagement). This page lists my everyday practice to maintain good health and energy level. In addition to the book, I also referred to many other articles.

I must be honest: I'm not there yet. Actually, kind of far away from there. This list serves as a reminder to tell me what I need to actively work on.

- Do morning warm-up exercises on the balcony. The purposes are:
  - Get daily sunlight exposure. [1]
  - Stretch my body from the whole night sleep to prepare for the day.
- Try to stand more during work. [1]
- Food & drink:
  - Drink more water. [1]
  - Avoid as much added sugar as possible.
  - Do not consume too much carbo-hydrates.
  - Eat more vegetables.
  - Eat more healthy protein (such as white meat and eggs).
- Try to avoid the distraction by cellphones. [1]
- Build up a ritual (reading books) before night sleep. The purposes are:
  - Improve the sleep quality during night.
  - Make time for reading.
- Start to act if I find I spend too much time in (over)thinking. [1]

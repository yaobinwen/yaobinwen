# Guidelines

## 1. Overview: What is this?

The guidelines in this document serves a few purposes:

- 1). Help me keep the good habits.
- 2). Remind me of the good practices I want to do (so I can gradually internalize them into my daily routine).
- 3). Track the habits or practices I'm experimenting.

The ultimate purpose is to help me establish good habits in order to make the best of my life.

## 2. How to use?

Review this document **every two weeks** (i.e., twice a month). Update the document (i.e., add the new ones I've learned and remove the old ones I find ineffective) if needed.

Specifically:

- 1). For mental models, review them and reflect if I am following them.
- 2). For habits, review them and reflect if I'm following them, and update them if needed.

## 3. Mental Models

## 3.1 Prioritize work

80/20 law

## 3.2 Set a deadline

Parkinson's law: If you don't set a deadline, the work will take as much time as you provide.

## 3.3 Focus on one task and avoid distraction

Nowadays people like the idea of "multi-tasking" and, in my opinion, in many situations, multi-tasking is needed. But people should not forget the importance of focusing on **one task** and **get it done**.

Avoid distraction, especially social media. Try to do "deep work" [1].

## 3.4 行动协同原则(synthetic actions): 所有的行动都应该为目标服务

> When you are working on a goal, make sure all your actions cooperate with and strengthen, rather than conflict with and thus weaken, each other, to produce a greater power than doing them separately.

## 3.5 Follow your fears

那些让我很担心、焦虑、害怕的事情，是阻碍我正常生活的事情，与其一味逃避它们，不如正视它们。所以我需要持续地关注这些事情。

## 3.6 Use the books rather than just read them

Many times people brag about how many books they read in a year. But finishing reading the books doesn't mean the books help you improve your life. You must integrate what you have learned from the books into your daily life.  Simply put: **USE THEM**. So what really counts is the number of books you have **actually used**.

### 3.7 Manage energy instead of time

You can't manage your time. What you need to do is manage your energy. [2]
